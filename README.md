# Tailwind CSS not working after installation
This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to HTML elements after installation and configuration.  The problem often stems from incorrect import statements or missing configuration steps. This example shows the problem and its solution.

## Problem
After installing Tailwind CSS and configuring it according to the official documentation, the CSS styles are not applied.

## Solution
Ensure that you have correctly imported Tailwind's base, components, and utilities in your CSS file and imported this CSS file into your main JavaScript (or similar) file.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.  You'll observe that Tailwind's classes do not have any visual impact on elements.

## How to fix
Review the code in `bugSolution.js` and `index.css` to see the correct implementation.
